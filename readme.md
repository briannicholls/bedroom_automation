# Bedroom Automation with Raspberry Pi

MicroPython code for my Raspberry Pi Pico to automate various tasks.

Components utilized:
- Passive Infrared Sensor for sensing human presence in the room
- Photoresistor for detecting daylight hours
- 360° servo motor for turning the wand to open/close blinds
- 7Ω solenoid for pressing the physical power button on my air filter

## Short Term Goals
- Open my blinds in the morning when the sun comes out
- Turn on my air filter after leaving the room, or every x hours
- Add physical buttons for manual control
- Add physical switches for enabling/disabling features
  
## Long Term Goals
- Implement a winch to close my bedroom door to improve air filter efficiency
- Add "debugging" mode with buttons & LEDs on control panel
